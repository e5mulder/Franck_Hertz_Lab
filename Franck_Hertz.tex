\begin{abstract}
The Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates the quantum mechanical nature of atoms: the energy levels are discrete. 
In this experiment, electrons generated at the cathode are accelerated to increasing energies and sent through an atomic gas. The current of electrons which reaching the anode (converted to a voltage by sending it across a resistor) is measured. 
Since the atoms can only gain discrete amounts of energy, there will be dips in the current, corresponding to the electrons transferring all their energy to the atoms at those discrete values, and subsequently unable to reach the anode.
By looking at the spacing of dips in the data, one can determine the transition energies of the atom. 
We performed the Franck-Hertz experiment with neon and mercury gas, with the mercury at various temperatures. 
We also performed the experiment with mercury at 204\degree C using a lock-in amplifier by adding small sinusoidal oscillations on top of the relatively larger voltage used to accelerate the electrons.
We visually estimated the minima locations and uncertainties directly from the plots. 
This gave better results compared to using curve fits to determine the minima.
We obtained an estimate of $4.76\pm 0.1$eV of the lowest excitation energy of mercury from our minima spacing data.
This lies between accepted values for the first two transition energies of mercury,  $4.67$eV and $4.89$eV, but agrees with only the first one.~\cite{new}
We think the discrepancy is caused by the lack of control in accelerating voltage, which made it difficult to take data points at small, consistent intervals, and so accurately determine minima.
We think finer control of the accelerating voltage would allow us to collect better data, leading to more defined minima, allowing us to more accurately determine the lowest excitation energy of mercury.

\section{Introduction} 

The Franck-Hertz Experiment is named for James Franck and Gustav Hertz, who used it to demonstrate discrete energy levels in atoms. 
They received the Nobel Prize in 1925 for their work on this experiment. 
In the experiment a beam of electrons is sent through a cloud of atoms, usually mercury or neon. 
Atoms can only gain energy in an amount equal to an allowed transition between energy levels. 
Only electrons with energies equal to these transition energies can transfer their energy to an atom. 
Electrons that have too much or too little energy will collide elastically with the atoms, keeping their energy. 
We find the transition energies by measuring the current of electrons leaving the gas - fewer reach the detector when they transfer energy to atoms in collisions. 
The loss in energy keeps those electrons from overcoming the retarding voltage at the anode. 
This causes dips (minima) in the current at voltages where many electrons can reach a transition energy one or more times during their journey through the gas. 
The spacing of the minima (in volts) gives the energy (in electron-volts) that colliding electrons gain between collisions - assuming the electrons lose all their energy in collisions. 
The next minimum occurs when the electrons gain back just enough energy to collide and lose their energy again. 
This energy gain - from zero to collision energy - is a transition energy of the atom. 
In this way the Franck-Hertz experiment can be used to determine the transition energies of the atom. 
Further research on the Franck-Hertz experiment in Mercury has shown a temperature dependence of the minima spacings, and examined how the minima spacings increase slightly at higher voltages. 
In our analysis we investigated temperature dependence briefly to chose a temperature at which the pattern in the data was most clearly defined, and we used the expected increase in minima spacing with voltage to better estimate the actual transition energy occuring in the gas. 


\section{Methods}

For this experiment we used a Franck-Hertz experimental apparatus from ELWE. A diagram is shown in Figure ~\ref{set-up}. 
First, we heat the oven containing the glass tube with mercury gas to the desired temperature. 
(In the diagram the part of the apparatus conatined in the oven is shaded grey.) 
Next, a filament with 120 mA of current creates a cloud of electrons inside the mercury gas. 
We set the filament voltage by placing an ammeter in line between the control box and the filament, then raising the filament voltage until the meter stabilized at 120mA. 
Inside the gas, a potential difference (which we call the accelerating voltage) drives the electrons through the apparatus. 
The voltage is applied to a grid inside the gas - it attracts the electrons but allows them to pass through it, eventually reaching the anode. 
We can control the energies of the electrons by varying the accelerating voltage. 
Electrons which have transferred energy in collisions have less energy at the other end of the apparatus, and a retarding potential prevents these electrons from reaching the anode. 
We set the retarding potential at 5 V. %check this number
The current at the anode is converted to a voltage by the apparatus - the current runs through a resistor inside the control box, and the control box has an output which is the voltage across that resistor. 
This voltage is our output voltage. 
To take data, we slowly increased the accelerating voltage from zero until the gas began to ionize, and measured the output voltage from the anode. 

We performed this experiment with neon gas and mercury gas. 
The neon experiment yielded poor data: we could only discern two peaks, and their shapes were irregular. 
Therefore, we took the bulk of our data with mercury. 
The mercury gas experiment was performed with gas temperatures from 170\degree--210\degree C. 
Then was done so we could select an optimum temperature at which to take data with the lock-in. 
We decided on 204 \degree C. 

For direct measurements, we connected the accelerating voltage from the control box to a multimeter, and the output voltage to another multimeter. 
With the computer, we plotted accelerating voltage versus output voltage. 
The procedure for using the lock-in was more complicated. 
We used a function generator to add a periodic voltage on top of the accelerating voltage supplied by the control box. 
We then connected the reference from the function generator and the output voltage to the lock-in detector, and the resulting signal went to the second multimeter in place of the unmodified output voltage. 
Using the lock-in had the effect of taking the derivative of the orignal data - the minima locations changed, as did the shape of the peaks and dips. 
However, the spacing between the minima of the lock-in data had the same period as the original data: taking the derivative of a periodic funciton does not change its period. 
Therefore we used the minima spacing from both the direct data and the lock-in data to try and extract the transition energy.

\section{Results}

Figure ~\ref{alltemps} shows our data for mercury gas at various temperatures. 
At lower temperatures, the output voltage values rose more quickly, and ionization voltage (where we stopped taking data) occured at lower values of accelerating voltage. 
At high temperatures the output voltage values rose slowly, so we could record more peaks before ionization, but the earlier peaks were shallower and less well defined.

\label{alltemps}
\end{figure}


After comparing the curves, we decided that the data for 204 \degree C (the blue curve in Figure ~\ref{alltemps}) had the most minima without losing the first few to the decreasing amplitude. Figure ~\ref{204CbackFit} shows our data with a polynomial background fit.

\end{figure}

We also took data by the lock-in method, shown in Figure ~\ref{nobacklock} in the Analysis section with the background subtracted. 

\section{Analysis}
Since we only saw two dips in our neon data, we did no further analysis it. Our mercury data was imported into Igor Pro. Most of our analysis was performed on data at 204\degree C. 
We first fit a background curve to both the data using the lock-in and the data without so it can be removed.
It is easier to determine the minima without the background present.
The curves were fitted using trial and error; we picked the one that best split the oscillations of the output voltage into equal amplitudes above and below the background. 
Fig. \ref{nobacknolock} and \ref{nobacklock} show the output voltage with the background removed.

\end{figure}

The minima for the data without the lock-in look parabolic while those of the lock-in data look linear.
We performed linear fits on each side of the minimum for the lock-in data. The intersection of these lines was our estimate of the minimum.
The curve fitting was done using Mathematica, as the uncertainties in the minima from curve-fitting in Igor Pro were larger than the range we fit the data over, thus they were not a accurate measure of our uncertainty in determining the minima.
We determined our uncertainty by first altering the slope and intercept of the best-fit line determined by Igor Pro, such that the line was no longer a good fit to the data. We obtained high and low values of the slope and intercept. 
Thus our uncertainty in the slope and intercept values was half of the difference between the high and low values.
Finally, the uncertainty in our minimum was determined by propagating the slope and intercept errors.
Although this method reduced the uncertainty relative to that from Igor Pro,  the range of values for each minimum was still larger than what it appears to be looking at the data. Additionally, some values of the minima did not appear to match when we compared it to our data by eye.
At this point, we decided to use the old-fashioned method of estimating our minimum by eye as well as the uncertainty for our both sets of data. Then we calculated the spacing between successive minima (Table ~\ref{minimaSpacing} and Fig. \ref{nomineye}). 

The spacings should increase linearly with the number of minima, due to extra acceleration of the electron before it collides with an atom. The expected spacing between minima is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{energy}\Delta E(n)=E_n-E_{n-1}=\left\lfloor 1+\lambda/L(2n-1)\right\rfloor E_a,\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the mean free path of the electron (the average distance it moves before colliding), $L$ is the anode to cathode distance, and $E_a$ is the lowest excitation energy of the atom. The lowest possible excitation energy from Eq.~\ref{energy} is $E_a=\Delta E(0.5)$. \cite{new}
We can obtain a estimate of the lowest excitation energy of mercury by extrapolating our linear fit of data in Table~\ref{minimaSpacing} to $n=0.5$.

We estimated the lowest excitation energy of mercury to be $4.76\pm0.1$ from the minima of the lock-in data estimated by eye, of the no lock-in data estimated by eye, and of the lock-in data estimated by curve-fitting.


\section{Discussion}
Our main difficulty with this experiemnt was getting accurate values for the locations of the minima with small uncertainty.  As you can see in Figures ~\ref{nobacknolock} and ~\ref{nobacklock}, there are gaps in the data, especially towards the higher values of accelerating voltage as the curve becomes steeper.  When we zoomed in on each minimum to find the lowest point, the spacing between the points increased until it was difficult to tell where the minimum was.  The scarcity and scatter in the points also made curve-fitting difficult, so that our various fits with igorPro and Mathematica had large error. Estimating by eye was equally difficult, and we could not get the uncertainty below 0.12V for any of our minima.  

The solution to this ideally would be to take data with smaller increments of accelerating voltage, to fill in the gaps. However, we controlled accelerating voltage using a small knob on the control box, which did not allow for fine tuning. The scale on the readout went in steps of 0.5V, and even turning the knob as slowly as we could, the accelerating voltage increased by steps of 0.2V or greater, oftentimes slipping back to a smaller value before going up again. The large gaps in our data were caused by accidental twitches or bumps which, while feeling small, would cause the accelerating voltage to jump up. With the equipment we had,  we took the most detailed data we could. 

Of our two fits which we estimated by eye, only the data taken without the lock-in allowed for a decent curve fit.  After calculating the first energy transition from this fit, we got a value which falls between the known transitions for mercury, and is in agreement with one.  However, the uncertainty is too large to draw definite conclusions.  The lowest two transition energies for mercury are 4.67eV and 4,89eV.  Our value for the transition energy was: $4.76 \pm 0.1$eV, which is between these two transitions, and within uncertainty of the first transition energy. 









\section{Conclusion}
We saw dips in the output voltage, which was proportional to the electron current, as electrons were accelerated to higher and higher energies. The dips are caused by electrons losing energy to atoms through collisions, preventing them from reaching the cathode. 
We attempted to determine the minima location, thus spacing, using curve fitting techniques but the values we obtained contradicted our data upon inspection. Therefore, we estimated the minima location visually. The minima spacing increases linearly with the spacing number, and the lowest excitation energy can be determined from this. We found a value of for the  $4.76 \pm 0.10$ eV lowest excitation energy of mercury. This does agree the reported value of $4.67$ eV.
We can improve the accuracy and precision our experiment in a few ways. Increasing the control for the accelerating voltage, so smaller increments could be made, increasing the number of data points. This would increase the definition of our minima and make it easier to determine their locations.
